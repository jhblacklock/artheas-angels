            <h4>Mission</h4>

            <p class="lead">
              After my mother passed in 2010 from ALS, I vowed to do something each year to help others suffering from this disease. Then one of my dear friends from college, Whitney Cottrell Hill was diagnosed. It was one thing to watch my mother, who had lived a full life, pass away; it was heart-wrenching to see a young mother of four children figure out how to live each day while remaining positive and grateful. With the help of friends like you, we were able to help Whitney and her family ease the financial burden of this disease. Whitney left us in 2018. As with the way the universe works, a new dear friend has come into my life, Liz Branch, and her mother, Mary Schulte, is living gracefully with ALS. This year, we are raising money to go directly to Mary, to help ease the substantial financial burden that comes with this diagnosis. Living the day to day with this disease, which strips away an individual's ability to move, talk, and eventually breathe, is a tremendous financial burden, as the assistance required is not covered by medical insurance. Calling out to each of you to consider helping me in supporting the beautiful Mary Shulte!

          <img alt="image" class="img-responsive " src="img/steph-arthea.jpg"><br>
          <p class="lead">Arthea Buckman Paulos, 63, passed away peacefully in her sleep surrounded
          by loved ones on August 24, 2010 following a courageous battle with Lou Gehrig’s Disease
          (ALS). Arthea was born on January 29, 1947 in Savanna, Illinois to Arthur and Dorothea
          Buckman. After Arthea’s birth, she and her family moved to Kankakee, Illinois where she
          was raised alongside her four younger siblings. Arthea graduated from Northwestern School
          of Dental Hygiene in 1966. She married Peter E. Paulos on September 11, 1966 and they had
          three beautiful children together in Salt Lake City, Utah where they made it their home
          for 34 years. Arthea loved being a “grammy” to her six beautiful grandchildren. She was a
          loyal friend, a loving mother and grandmother and a constant presence in her children’s
          lives. Arthea was a second mom to many and will be dearly missed!</p>

          <h4>Whitney Cottrell Hill</h4>
          <img alt="image" class="img-responsive " src="img/whitney.png"><br>
          <p class="lead">Whitney Cottrell Hill passed away on August 13, 2018 from complications related to ALS. She was born on July 21, 1976 in Ogden, Utah, to Lynn and Susan Cottrell. Whitney graduated from Woods Cross High School in Bountiful and went on to graduate from the University of Utah, majoring in Human Development. She is a proud member and former chapter President of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Throughout her schooling she was fortunate to make many dear and lifelong friends. She met her future husband, David, in the fall of 1998, and they fell deeply in love with each other. David soon suspected that Whitney may have dated half of the people in Salt Lake and was related to the other half. Marriage in the L.D.S. Salt Lake Temple followed seven months later and the Hill family began. She is the love of his life. Whitney gave birth to four beautiful children who love and admire her deeply. She loved to watch her children grow and learn and succeed and live. She attended countless dance performances and school plays, sat in the snow and rain watching hundreds of soccer games, cheered them on at volleyball and basketball, and helped with homework and projects. She volunteered in their classrooms and loved watching them participate in their class activities. She was unrivaled in making their Halloween costumes. They each inherited her spunk, her whit, and her grace. They have her beautiful smile and her great love for people in their hearts. They are her greatest happiness. They are her greatest legacy.

          <h4> About ALS</h4>
          <article>
            <p class="lead">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive, invariably fatal neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscles (muscle action we are able to control, such as those in the arms, legs, and face). The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons.</p>

            <p class="lead">Although the life expectancy of a person with ALS averages about two to five years from the time of diagnosis, this disease is variable, and many people can live with the disease for five years and more. More than half of all people with ALS live more than three years after diagnosis.</p>

            <p class="lead">Once ALS starts it almost always progresses, eventually taking away the ability to walk, dress, write, speak, swallow, and breathe and shortening the life span.  How fast and in what order this occurs is very different from person to person.  While the average survival time is 3 years, about twenty percent of people with ALS live five years, 10 percent will survive ten years and five percent will live 20 years or more.</p>

            <p class="lead">Progression is not always a straight line in an individual either.  It is not uncommon to have periods lasting weeks to months where there is very little or no loss of function.  There are even very rare examples in which there is significant improvement and recovery of lost function.  These ALS "arrests" and "reversals" are unfortunately usually transient.  Less than 1% of patients with ALS will have significant improvement in function lasting 12 months or more.  </p>

            <p class="lead">The onset of ALS often involves muscle weakness or stiffness as early symptoms. Progression of weakness, wasting and paralysis of the muscles of the limbs and trunk as well as those that control vital functions such as speech, swallowing and later breathing generally follows. There can be significant costs for medical care, equipment and home health caregiving later in the disease.</p>


            <p class="lead">Approximately 6,400 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. The incidence of ALS is two per 100,000 people, and it is estimated that more than 20,000 Americans may be living with ALS at any given time.</p>


            <p class="lead">ALS occurs throughout the world with no racial, ethnic or socioeconomic boundaries and can affect anyone. Military veterans are approximately twice as likely to develop ALS.</p>
